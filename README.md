# Cloudy_processing

A post-processing pipeline for [Cloudy](https://gitlab.nublado.org/cloudy/cloudy), the photoionization and plasma simulation code.  
This project aims to provide tools for analyzing, visualizing, and extracting physical insights from Cloudy simulation outputs.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goals
- Build a modular Python-based pipeline for post-processing Cloudy results.
- Provide scripts and utilities for:
  - Parsing Cloudy output files.
  - Extracting emission line intensities, continua, and diagnostic ratios.
  - Visualizing results (e.g. spectra, contour plots, parameter scans).
- Create a framework that can be easily extended for future AGN and ISM studies.
